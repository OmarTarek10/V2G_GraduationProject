Electric Vehicle with Driver Assistance Using E-Mobility V2G Technology Based on AUTOSAR
Overview
We are delighted to present our graduation project titled "Electric Vehicle with Driver Assistance Using E-Mobility V2G Technology Based on AUTOSAR." This project was mentored and supervised by Siemens EDA (Siemens Digital Industries Software), Dr. Hany Saad, Eng. Mona H., and Eng. Keroles Khalil.

Project Description
Our project focuses on developing an AUTOSAR-based V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) stack that adheres to the ISO 15118 standard, which governs communication between electric vehicles and charging stations. The stack implements the Smart Charging mechanism, providing a reliable and efficient solution. Additionally, it includes a V2G sniffer for displaying and analyzing all V2G packets.

Key Contributions
V2G Transport Layer
Description: Developed the TCP protocol based on the TCP/IP AUTOSAR module specification, release R23-11. This implementation meets the requirements of the ISO 15118-20 Transport layer and complies with the IETF RFC 793 and IETF RFC 768 specifications.
SoAd Module (SocketAdaptor)
Description: Developed the SocketAdaptor module based on the AUTOSAR specification, release 23-11. This module satisfies the ISO 15118-20 Transport layer requirements and adheres to the IETF RFC 793 and IETF RFC 768 specifications.
System Integration
Role: Team Leader.
Description: Played a crucial role in integrating all OSI layers of the V2G Stack and integrating most of the system's ECUs. Additionally, contributed to identifying and resolving bugs and various issues encountered during the integration process.
